# vagrant-tool
A vagrant tool/ script to make setting up and accessing vagrant vms easier :)

## Getting Started
Clone the repo to local machine
> git clone https://github.com/naimulh247/vagrant-tool/ 

To add all of the functions when terminal is starts up, add the following commad at the end of the terminal's profile file (.zshrc, .bashrc, etc)
`source $HOME/{path to vagrant.sh}/vagrant.sh`

Completely quite the terminal, and re-open for the changes to take effect.
